# Policing Research Style

## Purpose

Bridge the gap between technically correct academic writing and genuinely engaging scientific narrative. The existing `academic-paper-writer` handles structure (IMRAD) and `chicago-social-science-style` handles rigor (causal language, hedging). This skill adds **readability, engagement, and human feel**.

**The problem with most academic prose:** Robotic data dumps. Numbers without meaning. Monotonous sentence patterns. No narrative momentum.

**What exemplary papers do differently:** They tell stories with data. They vary rhythm. They explain why numbers matter. They make readers care.

---

## Part 1: Core Principles

### 1. Lead with striking numbers
Open with a number that stops the reader. Not methodology, not throat-clearing—a number that matters.

### 2. Move concrete → abstract
Named agencies, real cities, specific counts → then generalize. Never the reverse.

### 3. Vary sentence rhythm
Short punchy sentence after long explanatory one. Most sentences should be short, but not all.

### 4. Explain WHY each number matters
Every statistic needs an explanatory aside: what does this mean for the phenomenon?

### 5. Build narrative momentum
Puzzle → exploration → resolution. Create tension, then resolve it.

### 6. Insert authorial presence sparingly
"We posit," "Notably," "This suggests"—but let content be interesting, don't proclaim it.

### 7. Name real people and places
Phoenix and NYPD, not "large urban agencies." St. Louis and Raleigh, not "high- and low-rate cities."

### 8. The dinner party test
Would someone be excited to share this finding with their neighbor? If not, reframe until they would.

### 9. Link to current debates
Connect findings to policy questions, news events, ongoing controversies. Science doesn't exist in a vacuum.

### 10. Science can be entertaining
Give yourself permission to make it enjoyable. "There is no rule that science cannot be entertaining" (Buenz 2019).

## Part 2: Techniques

### Data-Forward Techniques

#### 1. The Striking Number Opening

**Before (generic):**
> This study examines organizational factors associated with police use of deadly force. Prior research has shown variation across agencies.

**After (number-forward):**
> Roughly 1,000 people are killed by police gunfire each year in the United States. Some agencies shoot at rates six times higher than others serving similar populations.

**Pattern:** [Striking statistic]. [Implication or comparison].

---

#### 2. Comparative Framing (ratios, multiples)

**Before:**
> The highest-rate agencies have significantly more shootings than the lowest-rate agencies.

**After:**
> The deadliest agencies shoot civilians 6.91 times more frequently than the least deadly, even after accounting for population and crime.

**Pattern:** [Highest group] does X [multiple] times more than [lowest group], [controlling for Y].

---

#### 3. Counterfactual Reasoning

**Before:**
> Reducing shooting rates in high-rate agencies would prevent deaths.

**After:**
> If all agencies performed like Raleigh—which has managed to avoid fatal shootings for five consecutive years—70% of police killings would be prevented.

**Pattern:** If all [units] performed like [exemplar], [specific reduction] would occur.

---

#### 4. Named Anchor Points

**Before:**
> Two large agencies illustrate the extremes: one with high shooting rates and one with low rates.

**After:**
> Consider that Phoenix has less than one-fifth the population of New York City, yet Phoenix officers killed more civilians last year. These aren't just random fluctuations—they reflect systematic differences in how agencies operate.

**Pattern:** [Named city/agency A] has [context], yet [Named city/agency B] [contrasting outcome].

---

### Human-Feel Techniques

#### 5. Sentence Rhythm Variety

**Before (monotonous):**
> The results indicate that agency-level factors explain substantial variance in shooting rates. The variance explained by organizational factors ranges from 15 to 25 percent. This finding suggests that policy interventions could reduce shootings.

**After (varied rhythm):**
> Agency-level factors explain substantial variance in shooting rates—between 15 and 25 percent of the total. That's not trivial. It suggests that policy interventions could prevent hundreds of deaths.

**Pattern:** Long explanatory sentence. Short punchy sentence. Medium follow-up.

**Key insight from Bushman:** "All the great scientists I've known wrote in short declarative sentences." Watson and Crick opened with 14 words. Keep most sentences short, vary length for interest.

---

#### 6. Building the Puzzle

**Before (flat):**
> Some agencies have high shooting rates while others have low rates. We examine what factors explain this variation.

**After (puzzle-building):**
> Consider two police departments, both serving cities of roughly 400,000 people with similar crime rates. Department A shoots civilians at five times the rate of Department B. Same population, same crime—radically different outcomes. What explains the gap?

**Pattern:** [Surprising observation] + [Tension/puzzle] + [Question that drives the paper]

---

#### 7. Explanatory Asides

**Before (number without meaning):**
> Black civilians are shot at 2.3 times the rate of white civilians.

**After (number with meaning):**
> Black civilians are shot at 2.3 times the rate of white civilians—a disparity that persists even after adjusting for local crime rates, suggesting the gap reflects bias in policing, not just differential exposure to dangerous encounters.

**Pattern:** [Statistic]—[interpretation that explains why this matters].

---

#### 8. Narrative Connectors

Show your thinking with transitions that signal logical relationships:

| Connector | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| However | Contradiction or complication |
| Despite X | Expectation violated |
| This suggests | Drawing inference |
| Nevertheless | Persistence against obstacle |
| Importantly | Signaling significance |
| Critically | Highest-stakes point |

**Before:**
> The full-sample analysis showed modest agency effects. The LEMAS-sample analysis showed larger effects.

**After:**
> The full-sample analysis showed modest agency effects—just 23% of variance explained. However, when we restricted to agencies with organizational data, this figure jumped to 62%. The difference suggests that sample composition matters enormously for conclusions about the "agency effect."

---

#### 9. Authorial Presence (SPARINGLY)

**Acceptable markers:**
- "We posit that..." (stating interpretation)
- "Notably,..." (flagging importance)
- "This suggests..." (drawing inference)
- "Critically,..." (highest-stakes point)

**Avoid weak intensifiers** (Bushman's rule): Delete "interestingly," "strikingly," "excitingly." If the content is interesting, saying so is redundant. If it isn't, saying so won't help.

**Also delete always-dispensable words:** "fundamentally," "certainly," "basically," "obviously."

---

#### 10. Explicit Unknowns

**Before (vague):**
> More research is needed to understand the mechanisms.

**After (localized uncertainty):**
> We can measure that agencies differ in lethality. We cannot yet determine whether this reflects differences in training, culture, supervision, or some combination. The mechanism remains unidentified.

**Pattern:** We know [X]. We do not know [specific Y]. [Name the gap].

---

### Story and Relevance Techniques

#### 11. The Dinner Party Hook

Before writing any finding, ask: How would I explain this to my neighbor over dinner? What would make them say "wow, I had no idea"?

**Before (academic):**
> Organizational factors explain 8 additional percentage points of variance in fatal shootings beyond community factors.

**After (dinner party):**
> Here's what surprised us: an agency's policies and training matter more for whether someone dies than the crime rate in their jurisdiction. That's not what most people assume—and it suggests reform efforts have been targeting the wrong factors.

---

#### 12. Link to Current Debates

Connect findings to ongoing policy discussions or recent events.

**Before (isolated):**
> Body-worn cameras are associated with lower shooting rates.

**After (connected to debate):**
> The debate over body-worn cameras has focused on their effects on complaints and use-of-force incidents. Our findings suggest a more fundamental effect: agencies with widespread BWC adoption shoot civilians at significantly lower rates. This reframes the policy conversation from accountability to prevention.

---

### Sentence-Level Craft

#### 13. Punchy Topic Sentences

Each paragraph should open with a sentence that summarizes what follows. The reader should know where you're going.

**Before (buried lead):**
> Previous studies have examined various factors that might influence police shooting rates. These include community demographics, crime rates, and officer characteristics. However, organizational factors have received less attention. Our study addresses this gap.

**After (topic sentence first):**
> Organizational factors have received surprisingly little attention in research on police shootings. Previous studies focused on community demographics, crime rates, and officer characteristics. Our study addresses this gap by examining agency-level policies, training requirements, and supervision practices.

---

#### 14. Paragraph Wrap-Up Sentences

End paragraphs by collecting what's important and setting up what follows.

**Before (ends flatly):**
> The variance explained by community factors was 15.3%.

**After (wraps up and transitions):**
> Community factors explained 15.3% of variance—substantial, but far from the whole story. The remaining variance suggests something else is driving cross-agency differences: the agencies themselves.

---

#### 15. One Idea Per Paragraph

If you find yourself writing "Additionally," "Also," or "Furthermore" mid-paragraph, you probably need a new paragraph.

---

#### 16. Subject and Verb Early

Get to the point. Don't make readers wade through modifying clauses.

**Before (delayed subject):**
> In light of recent calls for police reform, increased public attention to officer-involved shootings, and growing availability of crowdsourced data, researchers have begun examining agency-level variation.

**After (subject first):**
> Researchers have begun examining agency-level variation in police shootings. This shift reflects recent reform debates, increased public attention, and new data sources.

---

#### 17. Delete Always-Dispensable Words

Strike these without replacement: "fundamentally," "certainly," "basically," "obviously," "simply," "actually," "essentially."

**Before:**
> This is fundamentally a question about organizational culture.

**After:**
> This is a question about organizational culture.

## Part 3: Register Modes

Adapt density based on word count requirements:

### Tight Mode (Nature, Science, brief reports)
- Maximum data density
- Minimal explanatory asides
- Sentence rhythm still varies, but tighter overall
- Named examples compressed
- Every word must earn its place

### Standard Mode (PNAS, JOP, typical journal articles)
- Balance data + explanation + narrative
- Explanatory asides for key findings
- Full puzzle-building in introduction
- Named examples developed
- Comfortable pace

### Extended Mode (Annual Review, book chapters, dissertations)
- Full narrative development
- Extensive context and history
- Multiple named examples developed fully
- Room for methodological asides
- Reader education included

## Part 5: Integration Guidance

Use this skill in sequence with existing skills:

1. **Structure first** (`academic-paper-writer`): Get IMRAD sections right
2. **Engagement second** (`policing-research-style`): Transform prose into narrative
3. **Rigor third** (`chicago-social-science-style`): Verify causal language, hedging, precision

This skill **complements** the others—it doesn't replace them. The structure skill ensures your paper has the right bones. This skill ensures it has a pulse. The rigor skill ensures it doesn't overstate.

## Example Transformation

### Original (generic academic)

> This study examines organizational factors associated with police use of deadly force. Using data from 951 law enforcement agencies, we estimate hierarchical models with agency random effects. Results indicate that organizational factors explain additional variance beyond community characteristics. Policy implications are discussed.

### Transformed (policing research style)

> Roughly 1,000 people are killed by police gunfire each year in the United States—more than in any other wealthy democracy. But this statistic obscures a puzzle: some agencies shoot civilians at six times the rate of others serving similar populations. What explains the gap?
>
> Using data from 951 law enforcement agencies, we find that organizational factors—training requirements, use-of-force policies, supervision practices—explain substantial variance beyond community characteristics. Agencies with more training hours and stricter policies shoot less often. The implications are both troubling and hopeful: troubling because current practices are apparently preventable; hopeful because organizational change is more tractable than transforming communities.
