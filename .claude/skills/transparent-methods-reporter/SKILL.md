# Transparent Methods Reporter

Ensures experimental methods sections meet high-transparency reporting standards. Operates in two modes: **Draft** (write a methods section from scratch) and **Audit** (check an existing section against the 19-item checklist).

## Steps

1. **Determine Mode**
   - **Draft mode:** Write a complete methods section from researcher's notes/protocol
   - **Audit mode:** Evaluate an existing methods section, produce a compliance report

2. **Draft Mode: Write Methods Section**

   Organize the methods section into four subsections, ensuring every checklist item is addressed:

   ### 2a. Subjects, Recruitment, and Setting
   - Eligibility criteria for participants
   - Exact dates of recruitment and data collection (including follow-ups)
   - Survey firm identification and recruitment methods (if applicable)
   - Response rate with exact calculation formula
   - Setting details (lab, field, classroom, online) and geographic/institutional context

   ### 2b. Allocation and Treatment
   - Whether random assignment was used and the specific procedure (simple, blocked, stratified)
   - Unit of randomization (individual, household, cluster)
   - Baseline balance table (means and SDs by experimental group)
   - Detailed description of every treatment and control condition
   - Complete treatment materials in appendix

   ### 2c. Measurement and Sample Flow
   - Precise definitions for all outcome variables, covariates, and indices
   - CONSORT-style flow documentation:
     - N assessed for eligibility
     - Exclusions before randomization (with reasons)
     - N assigned to each group
     - Proportion receiving intended intervention
   - Attrition analysis: N per group lacking outcome data, relationship to treatment
   - Final analysis sample with rationale for exclusions

   ### 2d. Statistical Analysis
   - Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis: means, SDs, Ns for all groups
   - Clustering and weighting procedures
   - Multiple comparison corrections (if applicable)

   Generate LaTeX output:
   ```latex
   \section{Research Design and Methods}
   \label{sec:methods}

   \subsection{Participants and Recruitment}
   % [Content addressing items 1-5]

   \subsection{Randomization and Treatment Conditions}
   % [Content addressing items 5-9]

   \subsection{Measures and Sample Flow}
   % [Content addressing items 10-18]

   \subsection{Statistical Analysis}
   % [Content addressing item 19]
   ```

3. **Audit Mode: Check Existing Methods**

   Read the target file, then evaluate against the 19-item checklist. Report to `quality_reports/`:

   ```markdown
   # Methods Transparency Audit
   **File:** [filename]
   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
   **Score:** [N]/19 items addressed

   ## Checklist Results

   | # | Item | Status | Notes |
   |---|------|--------|-------|
   | 1 | Eligibility criteria reported | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL | [details] |
   | 2 | Recruitment and conduct dates | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL | [details] |
   | 3 | Survey firm identified | PASS/FAIL/N/A | [details] |
   | ... | ... | ... | ... |
   | 19 | ITT analysis reported | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL | [details] |

   ## Summary
   - PASS: N items
   - PARTIAL: N items (need improvement)
   - FAIL: N items (missing entirely)
   - N/A: N items

   ## Priority Fixes
