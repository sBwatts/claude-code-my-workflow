# Academic Paper Writer

Draft, structure, and polish academic economics papers. Provides templates for each section following journal conventions.

## Steps

1. **Identify Paper Type and Stage**
   - Empirical or theoretical?
   - Target journal/audience?
   - Current stage: outline, first draft, or revision?
   - Which sections need help?

2. **Follow IMRAD Structure for Empirical Papers**

   | Section | Purpose | Key Elements |
   |---------|---------|-------------|
   | Introduction | Motivate, state question, preview result | Hook, question, finding, method, contribution |
   | Literature Review | Position in field | Organized by theme, not chronologically |
   | Data & Methods | Describe strategy | Identification, data source, sample, specification |
   | Results | Present findings | Lead with main result, add controls incrementally |
   | Robustness | Strengthen credibility | Alternative specs, placebos, falsification |
   | Conclusion | Summarize and look forward | Restate finding, implications, limitations |

3. **Apply Economics Writing Conventions**
   - **First paragraph** states the research question AND main finding
   - **Present tense** for established facts, past tense for your findings
   - **Precise causal language:** "effect" only with credible identification; "association" otherwise
   - **Cite heavily** in literature review
   - **Lead with numbers** in results section

4. **Generate LaTeX Sections**

   Produce LaTeX for each requested section. For results, integrate with `/latex-tables`:

   ```latex
   \section{Results}
   \label{sec:results}

   Table~\ref{tab:main} presents our main results. Column (1) shows
   the baseline specification. The coefficient on [TREATMENT] is
   [ESTIMATE] (s.e. = [SE]), significant at the [LEVEL] percent level.

   % Table generated by modelsummary — see /r-econometrics and /latex-tables
   \input{tables/main_results.tex}
   ```

5. **Cross-Reference Lifecycle Skills**

   This skill integrates outputs from the full research lifecycle:

   | Section | Built from |
   |---------|-----------|
   | Introduction | `/scientific-narrative-builder` (Why funnel) |
   | Literature Review | `/lit-review-assistant` (synthesis + BibTeX) |
   | Data & Methods | `/causal-hypothesis-architect` (identification) + `/transparent-methods-reporter` (checklist) |
   | Results | `/r-econometrics` or `/python-econometrics` (estimation) + `/latex-tables` (formatting) |
   | Full paper | This skill assembles everything |

   For slide versions of the paper content, see `/create-lecture`.

## Writing Tips

### Introductions
- First sentence grabs attention — not "This paper examines..."
- State contribution clearly — what's new?
- Be specific about magnitudes — not just "large effect"
- Acknowledge limitations preemptively in the last paragraph

### Results
- Lead with the coefficient — put the number in the first sentence
- Interpret economically — what does 0.05 mean in real terms?
- Guide the reader through tables column by column
- Distinguish statistical from economic significance

### Conclusions
- Don't introduce new results — synthesize
- Be honest about limitations
- End on the contribution — remind readers why this matters

## Common Pitfalls

- Burying the main result in the middle of the paper
- Using "significant" without specifying statistical or economic
- Over-claiming causality without proper identification
- Literature review that's just a chronological list
- Conclusion that merely summarizes without adding insight
